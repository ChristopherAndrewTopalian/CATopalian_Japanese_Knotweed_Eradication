# WORKS - EASIEST
[Cut and Cover](src/methods/cut_and_cover/cut_and_cover.md)  

Knotweed is easy to defeat. Trash bags and Contractor Bags are cheap. We can tape the seams with Packing Tape or Duct Tape. We just keep the land covered for 5 to 10 years and the knotweed will be defeated. It's very inexpensive even for an acre.
When taping the seams together the more tape you use the better, because it will make a much easier time when adjusting your row.

We tape them together in rows to make it easy to remove any spears that come up to try to pierce it.

Remember, the more tape we use on the seam the easier everything will be outside. 

To make a nice row of trash bags, it's easier to tape it inside where there is no dirt.

We tape about 5 trash bags together at the edges with some overlap with a very long piece of tape for good strength. This row becomes very manageable outside.

The first time you apply the row outside the knotweed will start pushing up trying to pierce it like a spear.

You will pull the row of trash bags back and remove the knotweed spears.

You will then bring the trash bag row back down easily and keep it weighted so it won't blow away.

# Cut, Till, Dig, Screen All Soil

Eureka! It works!

We must get rid of EVERY single root! EVERY SINGLE ROOT MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE SOIL!

That means we must get rid of the spider web sized roots too!

We MUST SCREEN ALL SOIL immediately where we see the knotweed.

By screening the soil of every single root, we will eliminate the knotweed without having to use covers or chemicals.

Happy Gardening :-)

# Mud Brick Cover
We can make very thin mud bricks as land covering.

All that is needed to make them is dirt, water and any kind of material such as grass clippings, straw, and really anything from the yard debris, to give structure.

That being said, they will likely hold structure even without the extra added material.

The point of using the mud bricks is that it costs a lot of money to cover 1 acre of land with landscaping fabric.
Thus, we can instead put mud bricks that are thin over the land, because we don't have to worry about the mud breaking or costing us money and it will cover the ENTIRE land very effectively.

# Paperpulp Cover
You can mix old paper in a bucket with a paint mixer and drill. This will make a paperpulp that you put over the entire land in about a 2" to 4" layer.
The paper pulp will dry in the sun as you leave it on the ground.
Keep in mind that if you have an acre to cover, it would be too many tons of paper to pulpify. You would be mixing over 10,000 buckets of paper lol and 145 tons of paper lol.

> So, listen, realistically: BUY landscaping covers or sell your house and move. It's that simple.

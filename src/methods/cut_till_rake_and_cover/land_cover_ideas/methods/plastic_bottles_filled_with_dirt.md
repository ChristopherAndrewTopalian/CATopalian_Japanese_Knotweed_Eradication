# Plastic Bottles Filled with Dirt
We can cover the land with plastic bottles filled with dirt. 

It is not the ideal shape, but we can flatten them after we fill them with some dirt to hopefully block most of the sunlight from hitting the ground using more of a rectangle shape, than cylindrical.

* Recycles plastic bottles
* Lasts a long time
* Essentially free, since we bought the water anyways for life

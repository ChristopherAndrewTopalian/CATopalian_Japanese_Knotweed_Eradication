# **CUT, TILL, RAKE and COVER**
# Removing Stalks: 
YOU MUST WEAR A FACE SHIELD!  WEAR GLOVES TOO.
Remove every plant you see at the surface by using an aluminum snow shovel ðŸ™‚ with a circular swinging motion. Sounds funny but it has much inertia and you will hit yourself guaranteed when tired, so it's not as bad as a machete ðŸ™‚. You must make sure that not even one plant is still standing. 
Never let them get energy from the sun.
When you use a circular motion with the aluminum shovel you can easily clear an acre of Japanese Knotweed in less than 40 minutes.
Then you can take the Pick Axe and rip out the big Rhizomes that are causing the most trouble.

# Till the Entire Land  
After that you will pretty much TILL the entire land with the Pick Axe thick side, because that's how you eliminate it. You must rid yourself of all root systems.
But in the time it takes you to till the entire land, you will be stopping the expansion of the plant by always knocking it down with the shovel and always ripping up the rhizomes with the Pick Axe. 
Happy Gardening ðŸ™‚

> ## Removing All Japanese Knotweed means **TILLING** the land using a thin and long **PICK AXE**.  

You let the weight of the Pick Axe dive into the ground and then you LEVER it up. Do NOT drag the Pick Axe, because that would be exhausting and likely cause injury over time. Instead, we let the tool do most of the work as it was designed to do! BE CAREFUL FOR YOUR FEET. The metal Pick Axe is very dangerous.  

Make sure to WEAR A FACE SHIELD, so that you don't have any issues with dirt hitting your face and eyes. The face shield also helps keep the bugs away from your face very nicely.  

> Make sure to stop when you are tired, because you would risk injury if you are too tired. Rest is important.  

When you are TILLING the land using the PICK AXE and LEVERING the soil upward, you can collect the loose roots easily as you see them. But do NOT try to force the roots up by pulling them hard. Pulling hard on the roots means the person will most likely break the roots and therefore not fully remove the issue and by pulling the roots with hard force the person would risk exhaustion and the person is likely to suffer injury from that kind of pulling motion. Instead of using a hard pulling force with our hands, we use the PICK AXE and keep LEVERING the soil by TILLING a new line next to the roots that were hard to pull out. After we TILL multiple rows, the roots that had been hard to pull out, will now come right out very easily and very completely. That's the goal. The goal is 100% root removal by TILLING the land using a Pick Axe.  

Remember, to remove all Japanese Knotweed we must TILL the ENTIRE land 100% and remove all roots. The Japanese Knotweed populates the soil with what looks like thousands of root systems.
We set up many tarps so that we can continue to place the roots that we remove from the ground onto the tarps.  

> #### Note: Another reason the THIN and LONG Pick Axe is very good is because it has much less chance of cutting the roots than the THICK BLADE Pick Axe. Also, when you LEVER it backwards, since it about 1 foot long it pulls up most of the roots intact with each time you LEVER the Pick Axe up.

> #### AFTER we have used the THIN Pick Axe, the THICK Pick Axe can be used to fully loosen up the soil everywhere. Then we will rake the soil fully to remove ALL roots.

# Root / Rock Rake
The goal is 100% Root Removal!  

After we TILL the land using the Pick Axe, we then use a Root/Rock Rake to fully remove all roots from the ground.  

Of course, while wearing heavy duty GLOVES, as we are TILLING the land, we can collect many roots using our hands, but the primary way of collecting the roots is with the Root/Rock Rake to avoid injury. 

> Always make sure that you do NOT pull the roots with force, because it would break the roots and it would likely cause the person injury.  

> Instead of pulling the roots with force, we TILL the land with the Pick Axe in ONE or TWO more ROWS next to the area that was previously stuck in the ground.  
All roots can easily be collected when we TILL the land 100%

# COVER
Now that you have "rid" the land of knotweed, you have to cover it for multiple seasons to actually rid the land of the knotweed :-)

Yep, it costs money.

You pay for the material to cover the entire yard that has the infestation. Simple as that.

Listen, you can till the land 100 times and you will still have knotweed in the land if you don't cover it!

YOU MUST COVER THE LAND AFTER YOU TILL IT TO ERADICATE THE JAPANESE KNOTWEED FROM THE LAND.

# Inexpensive Covers
## Paperpulp Cover
You can mix old paper in a bucket with a paint mixer and drill. This will make a paperpulp that you put over the entire land in about a 2" to 4" layer.
The paper pulp will dry in the sun as you leave it on the ground.
Keep in mind that if you have an acre to cover, it would be too many tons of paper to pulpify. You would be mixing over 10,000 buckets of paper lol and 145 tons of paper lol.

> So, listen, realistically: BUY landscaping covers or sell your house and move. It's that simple.

Landscaping Cover is much cheaper, where you would need 25 rolls Ã— $53.99 = $1,349.75
The joys of gardening, lol.

Tarps? No. Too expensive and they allow water to puddle up.

IMPORTANT: If you do NOT cover the land, then the knotweed will come right back. YOU MUST COVER THE LAND!

Happy Gardening ðŸ™‚

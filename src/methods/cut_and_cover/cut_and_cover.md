# Cut and Cover

We work on horizontal lines.

We clear the bottom closest to our house on a horizontal line.

We then COVER that horizontal line with TRASH BAGS and weight them down with dirt.

The more we cover the trash bags with dirt the more they are protected from UV damage.

It's realy this simple to get rid of Knotweed.

---

Just clear the line and then cover it.

---

MAKE SURE TO OVERLAP the TRASH BAGS!

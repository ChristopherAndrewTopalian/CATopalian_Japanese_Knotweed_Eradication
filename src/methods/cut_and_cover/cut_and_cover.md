# Cut and Cover

We work on horizontal lines.

We clear the bottom closest to our house on a horizontal line.

We then COVER that horizontal line with TRASH BAGS and weight them down with dirt.

The more we cover the trash bags with dirt the more they are protected from UV damage.

---

It's realy this simple to get rid of Knotweed.

---

Just clear the line and then cover it.

---

MAKE SURE TO OVERLAP the TRASH BAGS!

---

One or two times in the season we may have to lift each trash bag up and remove the very small amount of very thin material underneath.  

But, in 5 or 10 of seasons, that ground will be cleared of Knotweed from keeping the cover over it!

---

We remove the trash bags for winter to preserve them for next season.

# Seams - Packing Tape or Duct Tape

Instead of using dirt to cover the trash bags down, we can instead use packing tape and tape the seams. 

Packing tape or Duct Tape will keep the trashbags together making them much easier to manage.
